# CRN Generator

CRN is Certificate Recipient’s Name. This tool automatically generates recipient’s names on a certificate template image.
The background of this project is when I had to insert some names on a e-certificate. 
At first, I use an image editor to insert names one by one. 
It took a lot of effort, time-consuming, and some possible typo errors.
So I decided to create this tool to help me. Just learn python so the code still not good enough.

## Built With

* [Python 3.8.1](https://www.python.org/) - Python
* [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) - Python Imaging Library
